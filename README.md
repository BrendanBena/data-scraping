# Data Scraping Tools
A github repo that include tools used to gather data for deep learning based projects. 

## NLP Lyrics-based Tool 
Our first tool will assist in NLP-based deep learning projects. With this we can make use of a python library created by GitHub user johnwmiller that allows us to scrape song lyric data from the popular lyrics website [Genius](Genius.com).
#### Step 1:
First, on top of the libraries we have already installed for prior work in Simmon's DL repo, we install the lyricsgenius library via the package-manage pip.
To do so, issue the command via terminal: 
~~~
pip3 install lyricsgenius
~~~
This will install not only the lyricsgenius library, but also some other useful libraries for data scraping such as beautifulsoup and requests.
#### Step 2:
Next, to make use of this library and Genius's API, we must obtain an access token from their website.
